# Getting Started #  

## Your first task will be to get your computer setup for the term ##  

The following document will help you get setup to succeed for the term.  In order to do this, you will need to have your machine configured.  As a computer science student, and eventual professional, it is expected that you would know how to get and install programs, run, and use programs.  

## Expectations ##  

It is not expected that you would know what to do or how to do things right away.  This is the purpose of learning.  However, if you can't get a program to install and run, then you are in for a very long term, and and even longer career.  Of course there are issues, and things happen, and when they arise we can troubleshoot them.  In the end, however, if you can't get a free tool to install and run for weeks on end, you aren't going to do well in the term.  It is not a valid excuse to say "My SQL Server won't install" for 7 weeks.  

## Tools That you will Need##  

There are a number of possible tools that you will need.  Talk to your team lead to get specific tools.  At a minimum, you will need GIT and some sort of editor, and you may need Docker/Docker Desktop. I also recommend Visual Studio code as you can do just about everything with it and it is free.

1. GIT.  
	
    The main thing you need from GIT is just to have it installed on your machine.  That being said, it offers a powerful BASH tool that works great when running GIT commands.  BASH is especially handy if you are used to Linux and are working on a Windows box.

2. Powershell [version 7] [Windows Developers].

    Powershell is built into Windows.  If you are not on a windows box, you don't need powershell as you have a terminal.  In the end, the **main** thing you need here is a tool that lets you run NPM [Node] and YARN commands.

3. Node JS [optional for those doing React/Angular/Vue/etc]

    In order to work on the front-end, you will need to get Node.js installed on your machine, specifically so that you have the ability to run NPM commands.  Make sure to get the latest LTS version (NOT the current version with latest features, use the LTS version only).

4. Visual Studio Code.  

    When you are working on the front-end [Angular/Vue/React/Typescript] side of the application, of if you want a great tool for Python, Java, C#, and other languages, you will want to make sure that you have at least tried Visual Studio Code.  The capabilities of Code are great and it's got the ability to do some things like built-in terminals that aid in your front-end work, as well as extensions for programming languages, Docker, Azure, Infrastructure as Code, Data Science, and more.

    Extensions here are also recommended:  

    -    GitLens
    -    JSON tools
    -    HTML tools
    -    Python/Java/C# extensions
    -    Azure Tools
    -    Docker
    -    SSH [for device development/linux connections]
 
5.  Sql Server Developer Edition or SQL server in a Docker container (or some other database tool like MySQL or PostGres).

    You will want to have some sort of database to work with.  Talk to your team lead for the specific tool.

    [Scroll down a bit to get the Developer Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)  

7.  Sql Server Management Studio or another tool to view your database.

    This tool is how you can easily view your database.  You don't actually need it, but you will likely want it.  

    [Download SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)  

8.  YARN for front-end NPM packages.  

    You don't actually need `Yarn`, but it is an extremely useful tool for getting node packages.

    [Download YARN here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)  

9. Docker

10. Docker Desktop
    
## Additional Tools ##

If you would like, I have videos on how to set up a dev box for Windows developers. [Here is the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQiL5-cjhJM&list=PLM_PAXX-MC3zSoFd-OKCXoqKx8UwWPI1V)  

## Final Thoughts ##  

Ok, that is a LOT of tools, and it's not all-inclusive.  Yes, it is, but each has a highly useful purpose, and each will aid you in some part of the development lifecycle.  The truth is you can pretty much do everything in Visual Studio, but it is not as useful and easy to do, so it's better to set your machine, and you, up for success.

An additional final thought.  Powershell and/or Yarn might ask you to install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).  If they do, you will find it is also a nice tool for installing programs on Windows.  You may also prefer to install via Homebrew on the Mac.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you get stuck or have any questions.  Remember to ask your team lead what tools you will need specifically to complete the work you are assigned.

## Next Steps ##

After getting all the tools set up and working on your machine, you are ready to move to the next task.
